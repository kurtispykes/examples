# Layer Example Projects

This repository contains example projects that you can use to get started with [Layer](https://layer.co).

### Note:
To run any of the example projects, users need to create their own integration.
All examples currently expect the integration:

    target: layer-public-datasets

Where `layer-public-datasets` is an integration name.
Integration `name` must be unique across the organization.
